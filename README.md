Contains a modified "Seville" Beamer template, "lugatuic".
In the future, this will additionally contain a Makefile for converting a Markdown file into a LUG slideshow!

This is still a work in progress!

# Instructions

To simply use the theme, copy the .sty file into the directory of your LaTeX code and insert `\usepackage{lugatuic}` in your preamble. (The preamble is the metadata before your `begin{document}`)

If you have a Markdown document you want to convert into a slideshow, please see the instructions below.
