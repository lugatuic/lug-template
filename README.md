# Description

A Makefile which converts Markdown files into Beamer Slides for ease of use and consistency. Also contains a custom Beamer theme based on "Seville".

If you are a LUG member, feel free to create your own slides in LaTeX with just the .sty file if you want more control over your presentation!

# Credits

# Instructions

To simply use the theme, copy the .sty file into the directory of your LaTeX code and insert `\usepackage{lugatuic}` in your preamble. (The preamble is the metadata before your `begin{document}`)

If you have a Markdown document you want to convert into a slideshow, please see the instructions below.
